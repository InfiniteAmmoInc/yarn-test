# Yarn Test

Unity parsing and execution code for Yarn dialogue files. Used in Night in the Woods (http://nightinthewoods.com) and other games.

WARNING: There is a new Yarn parser coming soon. It will be way cooler than this one. \\:D/

# Dialogue.cs

Contains the main code for parsing and running files. You should leave this alone for the most part.

# DialogueImplementation.cs

Contains the game-specific code. This is the file you'll want to customize to integrate the dialogue system into your game.

# Continuity.cs

Used for storing variables in the dialogue system. Useful for saving/loading dialogue system state.

# Twine

Should also be able to parse Twine files? Maybe? It used to! Note: doesn't support all twine features/functions

# Help!

Contact: hello@infiniteammo.com or @infinite_ammo on twitter for help.

I'm also available for short term contract work to help you fully integrate the system into your game.

If you end up using the system in your game, we'd appreciate it if you could add the Yarn logo somewhere in your start up and credits screen.
