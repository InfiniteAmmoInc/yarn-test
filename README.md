# Yarn Test

Unity parsing and execution code for Yarn dialogue files. Used in Night in the Woods (http://nightinthewoods.com) and other games.

# Yarn

Get the Yarn dialogue editor here: http://github.com/infiniteammoinc/yarn

# Dialogue.cs

Contains the main code for parsing and running files. You should leave this alone for the most part.

# DialogueImplementation.cs

Contains the game-specific code. This is the file you'll want to customize to integrate the dialogue system into your game.

# Continuity.cs

Used for storing variables in the dialogue system. Useful for saving/loading dialogue system state.

# Twine

Should also be able to parse Twine files? Maybe? It used to! Note: doesn't support all twine features/functions

# Help!
